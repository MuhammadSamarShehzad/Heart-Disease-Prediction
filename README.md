![heart_banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b048a035-007d-451b-bc7f-c6b61d8ec4c3)

Heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection and intervention are pivotal in reducing this burden and saving lives. This project leverages advanced data science and machine learning techniques to analyze one of the most comprehensive heart disease datasets available. Our goal is to develop a robust predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease at an early stage.

## Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover patterns, trends, and key predictors of heart disease through in-depth analysis.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate machine learning models to accurately predict heart disease.  
- **Insights Generation:** Provide actionable insights for healthcare practitioners to enhance decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a curated compilation of 1,190 records from five renowned research datasets. It includes 11 common features, making it a valuable resource for heart disease research. The sources are:  
- **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**: 303 instances  
- **Hungarian Heart Disease Dataset**: 294 instances  
- **Switzerland Heart Disease Dataset**: 123 instances  
- **Long Beach VA Dataset**: 200 instances  
- **Statlog (Heart) DataSet**: 270 instances  

**Source:** [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/heart-statlog-cleveland-hungary-final)

This comprehensive dataset provides a robust foundation for both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, combining diverse population characteristics for greater generalizability.
